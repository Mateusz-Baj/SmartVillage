# SmartVillage
<p> Interactive 3D geoportal for the village of Piskorz√≥w, using modern, open web and spatial technologies. The project focused on the creation of a lightweight and efficient application accessible via a web browser, integrating a Numerical Terrain Model (NMT), a building model in GeoJSON format and additional layers such as a cycle path, orthophotomap or OpenStreetMap.<p/>
<p> By using open source technologies such as CesiumJS, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Apache Tomcat or GeoJSON, even local rural governments are able to build modern, affordable geo-information solutions that increase transparency and efficiency in spatial management.<p/>
<p>The proprietary solutions developed as part of the project - including data conversion scripts, configurations and JavaScript modules - have been made available to the public under a Creative Commons CC BY licence, promoting the idea of open knowledge and enabling their further use, modification and development by other municipalities, local communities and interested developers.<p/>
